This project is a responsive user interface built with React, featuring a tab system and an interactive image gallery. Users can navigate through three different tabs ("About Me," "Experiences," and "Recommended") and upload images to a horizontal gallery. The layout is designed to be fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and tablet screens.
